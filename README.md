CAESAR CIPHER TOOL

A simple Python-based Caesar Cipher program that allows users to encrypt and decrypt text using a shift value.
This was created as part of my cybersecurity internship project on Kali Linux, focusing on understanding classical cryptography and its relevance to modern security.

FEATURES

Encrypt text with a custom shift value

Decrypt encrypted text back to its original form

User input for message and shift value

Command-Line and GUI versions available

Beginner-friendly and educational

HOW IT WORKS

The Caesar Cipher is one of the earliest known encryption techniques.

Each letter in the message is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

Example with a shift of 3:

HELLO → KHOOR (encryption)

KHOOR → HELLO (decryption)

USAGE:

COMMAND-LINE VERSION

Run the script directly using python3 caesar_cipher.py

EXAMPLE:

Enter message: HELLO
Enter shift value: 3
Encrypted Message: KHOOR
Decrypted Message: HELLO

GUI VERSION

Run the GUI script using python3 caesar_cipher_gui.py

FEATURES OF THE GUI

Input box for your message

Field to set the shift value

Buttons for Encrypt and Decrypt

Output displayed in a result box

SKILLED GAINED

Python programming 

GUI development with PyQt5

Classical cryptography concepts

Building interactive cybersecurity tools

Hands-on experience on Kali Linux

ETHICAL USE

This tool is built strictly for educational purposes as part of a cybersecurity internship.
It is not intended for malicious use.
